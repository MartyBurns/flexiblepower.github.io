## Virtual Machine ##
You can download a demo [here](https://github.com/flexiblepower/flexiblepower.github.io/blob/master/download/PowerMatcherSuite_13.10_Demo.zip?raw=true).

## Manual installation ##
The manual intallation instruction can be found on in the download file.

#Are you a consumer wanting to be a prosumer? 
Being a prosumer means producing your own energy next to the consumption of energy. Do you have a solar panel and do you want your washing machine to switch on when it is producing power?

You don’t have to wait for the market to be ready with a fully operational PowerMatcher infrastructure in place. You can download the PowerMatcher here and start to optimize your own house. The documentation explains step by step how you can install the PowerMatcher on a computer and how to connect it to your devices*

We already have a set of agents and drivers that work with a set of appliances. See if your appliance is listed here. Not in there and like a little bit of hacking? Join our community and get some support so that you can have a PowerMatcher system up in no time.

#Are you a company wanting a more green office?
The PowerMatcherSuite can be used to optimize your office building or even a set of office buildings. In addition the PowerMatcher technology can also be used to reduce your energy bill by using the flexibility of your system to buy and/or sell your energy smart on the energy markets. How can you achieve these things? Read on!

The PowerMatcher has been implemented in the Couperus project in The Hague to optimize a residential apartment building with solar panels and heat pumps. The PowerMatcher can also be used to optimize your climate control systems or electric vehicle park. But also larger industrial installations that have flexibility  can use the PowerMatcher technology to unlock their flexibility; for instance greenhouse farmers have CHPs, or datacenters have backup generators that are idle most of the time. Virtually any combination of devices is possible; load only, production only; or a combination of both.

The Energy Xchange Enablers (EXE) company is the first commercial solution that has leveraged PowerMatcher technology to unlock flexibility with clients (for instance a set of office buildings with a considerable volume of PV and battery installations) and use that flexibility to more effectively purchase energy on the energy markets. Your company won’t need an energy trading license to do this. Contact Energy Xchange Enablers here.

Want a flying start? All you need to do for your company to be able to leverage the PowerMatcher technology is to make your devices capable of talking PowerMatcher language. It needs a device driver and possibly a device agent. Check out our list of ready available drivers and agents or follow this tutorial that instructs your developers to build an agent quickly and easily.

#Are you an energy collective wanting to be self-sustaining?
The PowerMatcher is a very scalable solution for connecting cluster of residential buildings and local generation units. By means of the PowerMatcher a microgrid can be created that maintains its own balance. A coupling with the power grid is still possible for those moments that the generation capability of your microgrid is not sufficient to deal with the load. 

Please contact us here so we can work with you on a large scale rollout of the technology.

#Are you an aggregator wanting to harvest flexibility?
The PowerMatcher is available open source and can be used to unlock flexibility, even into household level, cost effectively. All parties are encouraged to take the PowerMatcher, which is licensed under Apache 2.0, and integrate it with their own solution. If you are looking for a standard out of the box flexibility trading platform, look no further.

The Energy Xchange Enablers (EXE) company is the first commercial solution that has leveraged PowerMatcher technology to unlock flexibility with end consumers/producers (for instance a set of office buildings with a considerable volume of PV and battery installations) and use that flexibility to more effectively purchase energy on the energy markets. The EXE company has released a commercial product that can be used by aggregators to trade the flexibility of the PowerMatcher cluster on the energy markets.

#Are you a device manufacturer wanting  to become PowerMatcher Ready?
All you need to do for your company to be able to leverage the PowerMatcher technology is to make your appliance capable of talking PowerMatcher language. It needs a device driver and possibly a device agent. 

The device driver entails the physical connection and mapping of the device control space to the FPAI control space. A device driver is manufacturer, type and model specific.  The benefit of developing a device driver is that in the future any Energy App like the PowerMatcher that interfaces with the FPAI platform can control your appliance.

The device agent contains logic to use the FPAI control space and construct bids for the PowerMatcher market. FPAI defines four abstraction categories (See FPAI): Uncontrolled, Time Shifter, Buffer/Storage, Unconstrained, therefore at least four types of agents are necessary. For each of these categories simple agents are already available open source and can be customized to your liking. You could add additional business rules or make the agent even smarter by including optimization techniques.

Check out our list of ready available drivers and agents or follow this tutorial that instructs your developers to build a driver or agent quickly and easily.

#Are you a developer wanting to help us move forward?
That is great news! We need all the help we can get to bring this disruptive open source technology out there. We have dedicated another page that will guide you into setting up a PowerMatcher instance. The source code can be found on github.com/flexiblepower. Detailed documentation is also available on github’s wiki as well as an issue tracker.

Spread the word and help our community grow!

#Are you a grid operator wanting to manage local congestion?
The PowerMatcher is a great tool for managing local congestion points, we have proven this in various test beds in the Netherlands and Bornhol island. This is also the reason why the two biggest grid operators of the Netherlands: Alliander and Stedin have already joined the FAN alliance.

Please contact the FAN if you want to join the alliance and/or bring the technology to your domain!
