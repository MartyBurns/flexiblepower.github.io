Stedin enters the FAN alliance in in order to join the cause. Stedin wants to support the PowerMatcher technology for smarter grids after having succesfully experienced the technology in the Couperus project. Stedin is the fourth participant that has joined the Alliance after Alliander, TNO and Accenture. In addition Stedin will enter the board of the Alliance.

# The Couperus Project

Stedin was using PowerMatcher technology in the Couperus project in The Hague. In this project the PowerMatcher is used to connect several heat pumps to wind generated energy. Heat & cold storage is used to balance the variations in wind energy supply. Stedin and the FAN are determined to channel their experiences in broader applications; expanding their knowledge from new construction sites to old buildings.

# Smarter grids are going to make the difference

Nancy Kabalt, CEO of Stedin: "Using heatpumps we can leverage ambient temperatures for the heating of buildings. Because of that gas connections can become obsolete in some areas, however electricity is still needed. Using the PowerMatcher we can better manage the electricity demand so that DSO can minimize new investments in the grid. Bert den Ouden, CEO of the FAN, mentions: "The Couperus Project is a prominent example. The PowerMatcher cleverly brings all aspects together: sustainable energy, the grid, storage and a new way of heating buildings. This technology could be the final answer to the targets that were set in the Dutch energy bill"
