Accenture has joined the Flexiblepower Alliance Network (FAN). 

# European Utility Week

On October 16th Maikel van Verseveld of Accenture and the foundation's general director Bert den Ouden signed the participation agreement  at the Energy Experience exhibit of the â€œEuropean Utility Week.  Accenture is the first new participant of FAN since the appointment of the general director. Accenture joins the founding fathers and first members, Alliander (the largest Dutch DSO) and TNO (the largest Dutch research institute for applied sciences).

# Global player

Foundation general director Bert den Ouden: Having Accenture on board is an important step. With the PowerMatcher Suite, we want an international orientation and with Accenture as an international participant FAN takes a big step in that direction. The Foundation is open to all new entrants and we hope to sign up even more similar parties. Maikel van Verseveld, Accenture: "All around Europe, utilities are seeking ways to develop new business models given the impact of the available distributed renewable generation and electric vehicles into their electricity networks. With the experience of FAN, we look forward to bring innovative concepts to our clients."
