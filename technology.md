The Suite comprises two disruptive open source technologies; the PowerMatcher and the Energy Flexibility Platform & Interface. Both technologies are complementary but can also function on their own. The PowerMatcher is a smart grid coordination mechanism. The Energy Flexibility Platform & Interface, EF-Pi in short, is an operating system  which enables appliances, the smart grid and smart services to communicate with each other.
