Imagine a house or building that understands your exact energy wishes. Selected controllable devices instantly snapping into action when the sun shines on the solar panels, or whenever local generated energy is available. And the electric car re-charging when energy is cheap. FAN connects every device with every thinkable energy management service, easily and efficiently. Using local energy and saving costs was never easier.

FAN is a new open standard that connects (household) devices with energy management services. FAN gives users control over the energy consumption in their house or building.

FAN can be built into devices and energy management services of diverse manufacturers. Thanks to FAN, they can work together as a team – to decide whether to use, store or sell locally produced energy, for instance, or to determine which device should be switched on first. Controlling the energy services on  a smart phone or tablet, users can set the energy preferences, ensuring that devices are turned on, off or down whenever they want. FAN makes it easy to use renewable energy and will mean significant savings on your energy bill.

Want to build FAN into your appliance or app? The FAN standard is available free of charge. You can download the initial release of the specifications and corresponding software now. Interested in our fact sheet? Download it here.
