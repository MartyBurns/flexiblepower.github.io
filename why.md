## The current situation in electrical networks ##
In a world increasingly concerned about the cost, availability and environmental consequences of conventional energy supplies, the electrical power industry stands on the cusp of a profound transition. Presently, the power industry has to cope with a growing electricity demand using an ageing electricity infrastructure. This in parallel with the transition towards generation through intermittent and decentralized sources of clean(er) energy poses landmark challenges for the sector. Consumers are becoming "Prosumers", by using energy from the grid at one time, while feeding in at another. Further, the supply-side controllability decreases since part of the installed capacity is intermittent and dependent on external conditions such as weather (wind, sun) or local heat demand (cogeneration).
If energy supply and demand responded to real time and varying energy prices, a huge potential for controllability gains on the demand side would be generated. For instance, charging of the batteries of electric or plug in hybrid vehicles would create a price sensitive outlet for off peak demand. To address these challenges in a cost-effective manner, the Smart Grid requires a scalable two-way coordination mechanism that is able to communicate and optimize over a multitude of small to medium-sized controllable generators and loads, with the Smart Meter acting as the key enabler.

## The missing link ##
The missing link is a communication and coordination protocol for Smart Grids, as part of a complete system architecture. An electricity network is needed that responds dynamically to the permanently changing supply and demand situations through real time market based solutions that automate control operations. Energy companies, consumers and regulators alike are seeking a vision for the grid, that extends the accommodation capabilities for increasing renewable energy generation. The envisaged system incorporates advanced grid technologies which enable complete grid communication and coordination from the consumer up all the way up to the network operator and the wholesale markets.

## PowerMatcher ##
To fill in the missing link, an innovative software solution was designed: *PowerMatcher*. See [about](/about) for a brief history on how PowerMatcher was established. PowerMatcher technology is a distributed energy systems architecture and communication protocol, which facilitates implementation of standardized, scalable Smart Grids, that can include both conventional and renewable energy sources. Through intelligent clustering, numerous small electricity producing or consuming devices operate as a single highly-flexible generating unit, creating a significant degree of added-value in electricity markets. PowerMatcher Technology optimizes the potential for aggregated individual electricity producing and consuming devices to adjust their operation in order to increase the overall match between electricity production and consumption.

There are already numerous implementations of PowerMatcher in the field, see [implementations](/in-practice/implementations) for a list of noticeable projects. If you want to contribute to PowerMatcher see the section [Get Involved](/get-involved). Also, if you are curious what PowerMatcher can mean for your business or how to make business with PowerMatcher, see [PowerMatcher Business Cases](/why/business-cases). PowerMatcher is maintained by the [Flexiblepower Alliance Network](http://www.flexiblepower.org) and the open-source community.

*"PowerMatcher is an ICT technology for making the electricity grid* **smart** *."*

## PowerMatcher Mission Statement ##
PowerMatcher aims to facilitate the implementation of standardized, scalable Smart Grids by providing a market-based coordination system for balancing demand and supply in clusters of distributed energy resources. Powermatcher intents to become the world's standard for the Smart Grid, accessible to anyone. By becoming more and more widespread, barriers for smarter use of electricity will decrease. PowerMatcher relies on the open-source community in order to become the world standard. 


#--New Page:  PowerMatcher Business Cases --#
PowerMatcher can be of use in various business cases. In most business cases, flexibility is of key value. In an electricity network where the supply is becoming more and more intermittent and less and less flexible, the ability to generate or consume electricity at a moment of choice becomes of high value. Several parties can provide this flexibility (*flex providers*) and other parties need this flexibility (*flex consumers*). Business area's could emerge where flex providers and consumers are linked with eachother.

## Business area's 
The following business areas can be identified:

*	Flexibility service providers (FSP)

The FSP aggregates flexibility from individual households and/or businesses and offers it to flexibility consumers. 

*	Community service providers (CSP)

The CSP aggregates flexibility from a group of households (e.g. a community) and offers it to flexibility consumers.

*	Energy service companies (ESCO)

ESCO's use the flexibility of individual businesses in order to reduce the connection capacity.

*	Domotics / Intelligent Homes

Use the flexibility available at individual households such that locally generated electricity is used on the spot as much as possible.

## Flexibility providers and consumers

The following parties are in need of flexibility:

* Balance response party (BRP)
* Grid operator (TSO and DSO)
* Individual end user  

The following parties are potential sources of flexibility:

* Individual households, notably with heat pumps and electric vehicles.
* Groups of households, communities, local sustainability collectives, owners associations
* Commercial electricity users
* Local governments and housing cooperatives
* Industries
 
## Example business cases
Business cases for the PowerMatcher can be found in electricity trading, active distribution management and in energy management in homes and buildings.

* Business Cases in Electricity Trading

With the PowerMatcher technology virtual power plants can be created, clustering numerous distributed generators, responsive loads and electricity storages in a single operational unit. Such a virtual plant is able to provide flexibility services for the balancing markets.
In a field test involving industrial & residential generation and demand response the PowerMatcher was used to balance wind energy production. The system achieved an imbalance reduction of 40 to 45%.
In the Dutch balancing market, a 100MW wind farm has approx. 1 Mio euros imbalance costs on an annual turn over of approx. 10 Mio euros.
 
* Business Cases in Active Distribution Management

In distribution system operations, PowerMatcher business cases can be found in network congestion management, network load profile shaping and black-start support, for instance
In a field test involving 10 micro-CHP systems at the premises of end-customer's premises, PowerMatcher showed capable of reducing the peak load at the MV/LV transformer with 30% to 50%.
