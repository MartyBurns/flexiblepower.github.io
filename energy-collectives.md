The PowerMatcher is a very scalable solution for connecting cluster of residential buildings and local generation units. By means of the PowerMatcher a microgrid can be created that maintains its own balance. A coupling with the power grid is still possible for those moments that the generation capability of your microgrid is not sufficient to deal with the load. 

Please contact us here so we can work with you on a large scale rollout of the technology.
