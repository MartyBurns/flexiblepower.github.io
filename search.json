In most business cases, flexibility is of key value. In an electricity network where the supply is becoming more and more intermittent and less and less flexible, the ability to generate or consume electricity at a moment of choice becomes of high value. Several parties can provide this flexibility ( flex providers ) and other parties need this flexibility ( flex consumers ). Business area’s could emerge where flex providers and consumers are linked with eachother. Business area’s The following business areas can be identified: Flexibility service providers (FSP): The FSP aggregates flexibility from individual households and/or businesses and offers it to flexibility consumers. Community service providers (CSP): The CSP aggregates flexibility from a group of households (e.g. a community) and offers it to flexibility consumers. Energy service companies (ESCO): ESCO’s use the flexibility of individual businesses in order to reduce the connection capacity. Domotics / Intelligent Homes: Use the flexibility available at individual households such that locally generated electricity is used on the spot as much as possible. Flexibility providers and consumers The following parties are in need of flexibility: Balance response party (BRP) Grid operator (TSO and DSO) Individual end user The following parties are potential sources of flexibility: Individual households, notably with heat pumps and electric vehicles. Groups of households, communities, local sustainability collectives, owners associations Commercial electricity users Local governments and housing cooperatives Industries Example business cases Business cases for the PowerMatcher can be found in electricity trading, active distribution management and in energy management in homes and buildings. Business Cases in Electricity Trading With the PowerMatcher technology virtual power plants can be created, clustering numerous distributed generators, responsive loads and electricity storages in a single operational unit. Such a virtual plant is able to provide flexibility services for the balancing markets. In a field test involving industrial & residential generation and demand response the PowerMatcher was used to balance wind energy production. The system achieved an imbalance reduction of 40 to 45%. In the Dutch balancing market, a 100MW wind farm has approx. 1 Mio euros imbalance costs on an annual turn over of approx. 10 Mio euros. Business Cases in Active Distribution Management In distribution system operations, PowerMatcher business cases can be found in network congestion management, network load profile shaping and black-start support, for instance In a field test involving 10 micro-CHP systems at the premises of end-customer’s premises, PowerMatcher showed capable of reducing the peak load at the MV/LV transformer with 30% to 50%.

It is capable of optimizing over high numbers of small units: distributed generators, responsive demand and electricity storage. The PowerMatcher is designed for scalability: in future power systems high numbers of smaller units, typically 100W to 5MW, will be involved in coordination tasks. The technology is using available open industry standards in both the ICT and energy sectors. Since its incarnation in 2004, the PowerMatcher has been implemented in three major software versions. In a spiral approach, each software version was implemented from scratch with the first two versions being tested in simulations and field experiments. The current, third, version is planned to be deployed in a number of field experiments and real-life demonstrations with a positive business case. A changing electricity system Electricity grids are facing a continuous increase of fluctuating renewable power sources. This increase happens on a central level (off-shore wind, large-scale solar power plants) as well as on a distributed, decentralized level (micro-scale renewables and CHP). Increasing volumes of electricity from wind turbines, photovoltaic generators and others cause power fluctuations that require additional balancing effort. World-wide electricity use is ever-growing. ‘The electrification of everything’, the growth in the number of devices that require electricity, is one of the main drivers. Over the course of the 20th century, electricity has made a transition from a novelty, to a convenience, to an advantage, and finally to an absolute necessity. key Features The PowerMatcher can be used for: Peakshaving Balancing energy production and demand The PowerMatcher approach Basic Structure and Agent Roles Within a PowerMatcher cluster the agents are organized into a logical tree. The leafs of this tree are a number of local device agents and, optionally, a unique objective agent. The root of the tree is formed by the auctioneer agent, a unique agent that handles the price forming, i.e. the search for the equilibrium price. In order to obtain scalability, concentrator agents can be added to the structure as tree nodes. A more detailed description of the agent roles is as follows: Local device agent: Representative of a DER device. A control agent which tries to operate the process associated with the device in an economical optimal way. This agent coordinates its actions with all other agents in the cluster by buying or selling the electricity consumed or produced by the device on an electronic market. In order to do so, the agent communicates its latest bid to the auctioneer and receives price updates from the auctioneer. Its own latest bid, together with the current price, determines the amount of power the agent is obliged to produce or consume. Auctioneer agent: Agent that performs the price-forming process. The auctioneer concentrates the bids of all agents directly connected to it into one single bid, searches for the equilibrium price and communicates a price update back whenever there is a significant price change. Concentrator agent: Representative of a sub-cluster of local device agents. It concentrates the market bids of the agents it represents into one bid and communicates this to the auctioneer. In the opposite direction, it passes price updates to the agents in its sub-cluster. This agent uses â€˜role playingâ€™. On the auctioneerâ€™s side it mimics a device agent: sending bid updates to the auctioneer whenever necessary and receiving price updates from the auctioneer. Towards the subcluster agents directly connected to it, it mimics the auctioneer: receiving bid updates and providing price updates. Objective agent: The objective agent gives a cluster its purpose. When the objective agent is absent, the goal of the cluster is to balance itself, i.e., it strives for an equal supply and demand within the cluster itself. Depending on the specific application, the goal of the cluster might be different. If the cluster has to operate as a virtual power plant, for example, it needs to follow a certain externally provided setpoint schedule. Such an externally imposed objective can be realized by implementing an objective agent. The objective agent interfaces to the business logic behind the specific application.

All you need to do for your company to be able to leverage the PowerMatcher technology is to make your appliance capable of talking PowerMatcher language. It needs a device driver and possibly a device agent. The device driver entails the physical connection and mapping of the device control space to the FPAI control space. A device driver is manufacturer, type and model specific. The benefit of developing a device driver is that in the future any Energy App like the PowerMatcher that interfaces with the FPAI platform can control your appliance. The device agent contains logic to use the FPAI control space and construct bids for the PowerMatcher market. FPAI defines four abstraction categories (See FPAI): Uncontrolled, Time Shifter, Buffer/Storage, Unconstrained, therefore at least four types of agents are necessary. For each of these categories simple agents are already available open source and can be customized to your liking. You could add additional business rules or make the agent even smarter by including optimization techniques.

The goal was to show that the technology not only worked during tests in a laboratory environment but also in real-life. 25 household were selected and outfitted with several intelligent devices such as smart washing machines, heat-pumps, solar panels and micro-CHP’s. The results showed that consumers can and will change their energy usage profile to benefit from lower energy prices when local power is abundant. Connecting devices and coordinating energy demands resulted in a lower peak in the grid and it significantly reduced the difference in supply and demand in the neighborhood. Another significant result was the insight that the technology was not yet ready for large scale deployment at that time. Particularly the installation and configuration of devices and the connection to the local market were complex and time consuming. Matrix V Location: Amsterdam, The Netherlands Late in 2011 the PowerMatcher™ technology was installed in an office building housing around 15 companies. The PowerMatcher™ technology was used to coordinate the energy production of PV on the rooftop with the energy demand of dishwashers and fridges in the coffee corners of the building. Goal was to determine if connecting existing appliances in office buildings to the smart grid was economically viable. The results showed that refitting existing appliances by adding switches and sensors to the mains plug of a regular appliance can be beneficial. However the benefits are bigger when using smart appliances where the technology is integrated. The reason is not only the higher cost of having additional equipment with which you can only switch on and off, but mainly the need for energy related information from the device itself. That information is usually available in smart appliances. Couperus Location: the Hague, The Netherlands In 2012 a new complex with 300 apartments has been outfitted with heat-pumps. The PowerMatcher™ technology helps to coordinate the energy use of these heat-pumps in order to reduce peak loads and differences in supply and demand. For the end users, the system should lead to a lower energy bill, without reducing customer comfort or freedom. FAN REFERENCE PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT PowerMatching City II Location: Groningen, The Netherlands PMCII is the follow up to PowerMatching City. The project started in May 2013 and more than doubles the number of household to around 60. The focus is less on the technological side but more on energy services and energy markets. The project will test how different personal goals of end-users have different types of impact on the local energy system. Some households will aim to minimize their energy costs, by buying when energy is cheap and selling when energy is expensive. Others will aim to minimize their interaction with the outside by using locally available energy as much as possible. Ecogrid Location: Bornholm The EU funded research project Ecogrid started in 2011 and will coordinate the energy demands of 2.000 households on the island of Bornholm (Denmark) with local production by wind turbines. Without added intelligence, the high penetration of renewable energy (>50%) on the island causes critical usage of the existing grid-transport capacity and may result in difficult if not impossible balancing of supply and demand. The participants will be equipped with residential smart devices using gateways and â€œsmartâ€� controllers. Installation of the solutions allows for real-time prices to be communicated to consumers and allows users to configure their automatic demand-response preferences, e.g. through different types of electricity price contracts. â€œAutomationâ€� and customer choice is one of the key elements in this project. Smart Grid Pilot Heerhugowaard Location: Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands One of the projects of the Smart Energy Collective (SEC) is located in the city of Heerhugowaard, more specifically, in a 10 year old neighborhood. Most of the 3.000 households have solar panels on their roofs. The remaining electricity demand is produced by a wind turbine. The project aims to install PowerMatcher™â„¢ technology in 300-500 households in 2014, with the addition of a number of microCHPâ€™s, electric vehicles, heat-pumps and smart appliances. The project will evaluate several customer value propositions regarding energy flexibility. The goal is to determine if the interaction of gas and electricity can be used to optimize a local energy market, by using spare capacity in the gas grid to reduce peak loads in the power grid. Lochem Energy Location: Lochem Lochem Energy is a smart energy initiative in an existing grid. It is the result of a user initiative to start a local energy cooperative by households to reduce their energy consumption and produce a larger part of their energy needs locally. The aim is to have a total of 1MW of PV systems at multiple locations to serve 250 customers, without any investments in new grid capacity. Partners are Locamation (coordinator), Lochem Energie, Universiteit Twente, Eaton Industries, Trianel and Alliander. Houthaven Location: Amsterdam The Houthaven project is part of the European NEXT-building program, in which a new generation of “low energy buildings” with smart technologies are tested in Amsterdam, Lyon and Helsingborg. Houthaven is an old harbor area which will be redeveloped. Once redeveloped, it will consist of 2.000 households and 40.000 m2 of commercial property (schools, offices andshops). The harbor areashould become climate neutral. Partners are Alliander, KEMA, city of Amsterdam, University of Kassel, University of Amsterdam, Ecole polytechnique de Lausanne, COWI a/s, Helsinborgshem, SPLA Lyon confluence, hespul, BKAB Boende Komfort and VOF Houthaven. FAN R&D PROJECTS VIOS Funding: Dutch TopSector (TKI Switch2SmartGrids) The Virtual Infrastructure Operating System (VIOS) project is aimed at the seamless connection of appliances to different smart market developments (USEF, OpenADR/Oasis, SEDC,..). Most smart market implementation are not designed to interact with each other, making it difficult to commercialize standardized smart appliances. VIOS creates this standard on the level of a virtual infrastructure, where a definition of connectivity makes it possible for both service developers and equipment manufacturers to optimize their part of the value chain. The project will show in practice how different types and brands of appliances can be coordinated uniformly by the same service. The concepts and designs are direct input for the FAN standard developments. Partners are Alliander, TNO, Technolution and iNRG. Energy Supply Cooperative (ESC) Funding: EIT KIC InnoEnergy The project Energy Supply Cooperative (ESC) is aimed at developing energy-autarkic, environmentally friendly residential quarters. A large part of the required energy will be provided by photovoltaic systems within the quarters, the energy consumption is reduced to a minimum by modern passive house technology. A maximal self-usage of photovoltaic energy is achieved by heat pumps with hot water storages and intelligent load shifting within the quarter. Additionally, socio-economic effects of energy consumption are analysed and opportunities for load reduction and shifting are derived. Electricity that cannot be covered by own production is obtained from an external energy supplier. In the micro-grid, an intelligent energy management using PowerMatcher™ ensures the optimal interaction between local energy supply and demand. In the end, the aimed innovations shall remain affordable for households with average incomes. Partners: Evohaus, KIT and TNO Hybrid Energy Grid Management (Hegrid) Funding: EIT KIC ICT labs Hybrid Energy Grid Management (HEGRID) focuses on realizing a prototype multi-commodity (electricity, gas and thermal energy) energy management framework. This framework enables interoperability of a variety of energy management approaches and devices. The basis of HEGRID will be formed by the Open Energy Management Framework: an operational platform that supports multiple smart grid approaches for the electric grid. This base platform will be extended to support gas and thermal grids as well. It will also feature a coordination mechanism that can make intelligent decisions across commodities (e.g. how to make the best use of a CHP that uses gas to produce heat and electricity). Multi-commodity energy management is largely unexplored territory, but is an important step to increase the efficiency, flexibility and stability of the combined grids. The project addresses essential challenges posed by the “Energy transition” to incorporate more energy generated from renewable sources.

The PowerMatcher could also be herded among the recently coined term transactive energy. “Transactive energy (TE) is a new hot topic in the energy industry, but what exactly is it? Frankly, it is a concept so new that it does not yet have a formal definition. Carl Imhoff, manager of electricity infrastructure for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory summed it up by saying, “Transactive energy is a means of using economic signals or incentives to engage all the intelligent devices in the power grid—from the consumer to the transmission system—to get a more optimal allocation of resources and engage demand in ways we haven’t been able to before.” The PowerMatcher concept is based on the micro-economic principle of demand and supply. Supply and demand is one of the most fundamental concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain good producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price expresses the willingness to pay for supply and demand. The relationship between demand and supply underlie the forces behind the allocation of resources. In market economy theories, demand and supply theory will allocate resources in the most efficient way possible. When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. The same mechanism is used in PowerMatcher. PowerMatcher core application provides the marketing mechanism for the determination of the equilibrium, while the agents work as actors representing demand and/or supply. Agent Technology The technology differentiates from other demand response technologies due to its multi agent based decentralized approach. The PowerMatcher consists of various agents that communicate via the PowerMatcher protocol. These agents are the: Device agent [plaatjes] Concentrator agent Auctioneer agent Objective agent The Device Agent In the PowerMatcher framework a smart device is represented by a device agent. The device agent contains logic to operate the process associated with the device in an economical optimal way. It translates the state of a smart device (battery charge is low or CHP output is 1500W and gas consumption is 0,61 Euro/m3) to a bid on the PowerMatcher market (see Protocol section). The device agent could also contain logic to make the device “smart” by including end user wishes as well external input such as weather or energy price forecasts. By taking into account this extra information the device can determine for itself what would be the best time to consume…. or produce energy. To steer and read out the machine, a “physical” connection has to be made with the device. This could be done by mapping the agent directly to the IO of the device or perhaps a web service as delivered by the device manufacturer. Instead we have chosen to run PowerMatcher on the FPAI technology as an intermediate layer; this only requires a connection of the device agent to the abstraction layer of FPAI. FPAI takes care of the actual physical connection with the device (see FPAI section). As a result the PowerMatcher device agent does not have to think about the type of machine, brand, or model number. The reader is referred to the FPAI section for a more detailed explanation of FPAI technology. The Concentrator Agent The concentrator agent performs three functions. The first function of the concentrator is the bundling of messages received from child agents. Children could be other concentrator agents or other device agents. The concentrator concentrates, or aggregates, all these messages and publishes a single message upward in the hierarchy. The second function entails the virtual representation of concepts or physical entities in the real world. A concentrator can bundle every smart device in a single household and therefore represent this household. A concentrator can also represent an electric cable, transformer or for instance a neighborhood. Lastly, the concentrator can be used to manipulate the children agents that are present in a sub cluster. Affecting a single concentrator allows for localized manipulation. The first idea of local manipulation that has been implemented in the PowerMatcher is the capability of local congestion management; by making the concentrator more intelligent it can peak shave loads and make sure that the net output of sub cluster stays within certain power limits. The Auctioneer Agent The auctioneer always stands on top of the hierarchy and bundles all messages received from child agents. The auctioneer determines the optimal set point (see Optimization Techniques) of the cluster and returns this set point to each child agent; each child node will receive this set point and forward it to his children….and so forth. The Objective Agent The objective agent gives a cluster its purpose. The objective agent interfaces to the business logic behind the specific application. The objective agent can be connected to the auctioneer or a concentrator agent. The objective agent can send external incentives to manipulate the other agent by means of the general PowerMatcher protocol (See Protocol section). When the objective agent is absent, the goal of the cluster is to balance itself, i.e., it strives for an equal supply and demand within the cluster itself. Depending on the specific application, the goal of the cluster might be different. If the cluster has to operate as a virtual power plant, for example, it needs to follow a certain externally provided setpoint schedule. Such an externally imposed objective can be realized by implementing an objective agent. Other couplings could be with the energy trading market, external optimization algorithms etc. Distributed nature and a message bus. The PowerMatcher is distributed in nature, however every agent can also run on a central server (Want to see how this works, follow the Get Started guide to setup your own PowerMatcher!). We hold the vision that in the future device agent logic will be implemented in physical smart appliances. The best solution presently is the use of FPAI that functions as a gateway operating system (a gateway can be compared to your router for connecting to the internet, like your laptop with Windows the gateway also needs an operating system) and unburdens the PowerMatcher from the connectivity and interoperability with physical appliances (see FPAI). Because of the distributed nature of the PowerMatcher the concept is extremely scalable. You can implement it on household level and have an auctioneer optimize your house. It can also be implemented by an energy collective or aggregator to optimize over a large system. The central server of the PowerMatcher that receives all incoming messages from child agents has implemented a message bus. A message bus is a common solution for “Internet of things” implementations. For a more detailed explanation the reader is referred to the specification section. PowerMatcher protocol Every agent in the PowerMatcher framework communicates via a standardized protocol. This protocol defines two way communication where the upward message in the hierarchy is different from the downward or returning message. The upward message consists of a bid curve. A bid curve describes the relation between “Power” and “willingness to consume or produce power”. This willingness is expressed as a price/kW. The downward message is the market price that balances the system. A small thought exercise, imagine a battery or cooler: [plaatje] When his state of charge is almost full a battery is only willing to charge at low prices, vice versa an empty battery is willing to pay a higher price to recharge. Likewise a cooler is willing to cool at a higher price, only when it reaches critical inside temperature and the tomatoes are about to go bad. A device agent generates new bid curves, or events, that represent his current state and willingness to pay for power and also the amount of power needed/produced. The returning message is the internal PowerMatcher price. This price is the set point that optimizes the entire cluster and was determined by the auctioneer (see Optimization techniques). The price message flows through every branch and to every endpoint, the device agent. The device agent maps this price to his prior published bid curve and determines its consumption or production set point, indeed that is the amount of power the device was willing to acquire or produce for that price. This power set point is communicated to the appliance by the device agent through the FPAI abstraction layer (see Device Agent and FPAI). Optimization techniques and the PowerMatcher optimization At the moment we distinguish at least three types of optimization system approaches: Centralized optimization (e.g. Simplex method) Decentralized optimization (part of the objective function is calculated locally) Agent technology In a centralized optimization system a control signal is often centrally imposed meaning a control center determines whether your air-condition should be turned on or off. A centralized optimization can also become very processing-intensive with increasing amount of connected devices and parameters. A decentralized optimization is already more in line with PowerMatcher ideology, yet we feel that the solution would still be too complex. In the PowerMatcher framework we relied on agent technology. Your appliance and agent will act autonomously based on your predefined settings (most cost efficient, most green energy etc.) and settings are never imposed. In other words, you still get to decide at any moment whether you want to turn your airco on or off. The PowerMatcher ensures that the end user retains full control but its energy consumption or production will be optimized autonomously as set by end user’s desired constraints. The optimization of the PowerMatcher is based on the micro-economic principle of demand and supply. When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. PowerMatcher core application provides the marketing mechanism which is embedded in the communication protocol for the determination of the equilibrium, while the agents work as actors representing demand and/or supply. Bid curve aggregation and determining the optimal set point As bid curves are send higher up the hierarchy they are received by the parent agent. A parent agent is always a concentrator or auctioneer agent. Both agents aggregate the received bid curves and compose a new single bid curve. Aggregation means as much as adding bid curves; bid curves that represent generation of energy, produce ‘negative power’ or ‘negative supply’ and are therefore subtracted. [plaatje] This is possible because apparently, within that sub cluster, there are two devices that cancel each other out at a particular price level. The refrigerator was willing to consume 500W at a price of 0,30 cents/kW and the battery was willing to discharge at 500W at a price of 0,30 cents/kW. After aggregation of all child agent bid curves a new aggregated bid curve is composed that resembles the net powerdemand as a function of the price. The auctioneer performs one extra action after aggregation to determine the optimal point of the system. Since the final aggregated bid curve represents the net power demand as a function of the price, the price where the net demand equals zero is the point where the systems supplies as much power as is demanded. This is the internal price where the system is in balance. Consequently this price is communicated down the hierarchy, each individual device will start consuming or producing energy as ‘promised’ by its bid curve. Optimization of current state and events The PowerMatcher always optimizes the current state. The state of the system changes due to events. So as soon as the internal temperature of a refrigerator changes it sends out a new bid curve, or event. This event is then dealt with within the PowerMatcher possibly causing a chain of events if the implications of the bid curve caused a significant change in the system. Flexible Power Application Infrastructure The Flexible Power Application Infrastructure (FPAI) provides a runtime environment that makes it possible to quickly design and implement new transactive energy services and devices. FPAI enables easy deployment and configuration of ‘Energy Apps’ and device drivers, and provides easy interaction through the energy flexibility interface. Now device manufacturers can write generic device drivers for their appliances that can be used by any control algorithm that runs on FPAI. Also any control algorithm that is developed on FPAI can make use of all available drivers. Since all of platform development is done in open source (see http://github.com/flexiblepower), anyone can contribute to this framework and no vendor lock-in is possible. A dashboard can show controls and information to the end user about the current state of your appliances in the form of Widgets. Each Widget shows information for an appliance. It is possible to have multiple Widgets per appliance. [plaatje dashboard] Drivers and Energy Apps communicate with one another via the abstraction layer. FPAI defines four categories under which all devices can be herded: Uncontrollable. These appliances are not controllable when they consume or produce energy. An example is a solar panel. Time shiftable. These apliiances are capable of shifting their supply or demand in time, however constrained within a limit. An example is a washing machine that needs to be ready before the break of dawn. Buffer/Storage. These devices are flexible in energy production. In addition they are coupled to a buffer such as a battery. An example is a heatpump or electric vehicle. Unconstrained. These devices are flexible in production and/or consumption, there is however no buffer or storage. An example is a generator.

Presently, the power industry has to cope with a growing electricity demand using an ageing electricity infrastructure. This in parallel with the transition towards generation through intermittent and decentralized sources of clean(er) energy poses landmark challenges for the sector. Consumers are becoming “Prosumers”, by using energy from the grid at one time, while feeding in at another. Further, the supply-side controllability decreases since part of the installed capacity is intermittent and dependent on external conditions such as weather (wind, sun) or local heat demand (cogeneration). If energy supply and demand responded to real time and varying energy prices, a huge potential for controllability gains on the demand side would be generated. For instance, charging of the batteries of electric or plug in hybrid vehicles would create a price sensitive outlet for off peak demand. To address these challenges in a cost-effective manner, the Smart Grid requires a scalable two-way coordination mechanism that is able to communicate and optimize over a multitude of small to medium-sized controllable generators and loads, with the Smart Meter acting as the key enabler. add image which shows the change in the infrastructure The missing link The missing link is a communication and coordination protocol for Smart Grids, as part of a complete system architecture. An electricity network is needed that responds dynamically to the permanently changing supply and demand situations through real time market based solutions that automate control operations. Energy companies, consumers and regulators alike are seeking a vision for the grid, that extends the accommodation capabilities for increasing renewable energy generation. The envisaged system incorporates advanced grid technologies which enable complete grid communication and coordination from the consumer up all the way up to the network operator and the wholesale markets. PowerMatcher To fill in the missing link, an innovative software solution was designed: PowerMatcher . See about for a brief history on how PowerMatcher was established. PowerMatcher technology is a distributed energy systems architecture and communication protocol, which facilitates implementation of standardized, scalable Smart Grids, that can include both conventional and renewable energy sources. Through intelligent clustering, numerous small electricity producing or consuming devices operate as a single highly-flexible generating unit, creating a significant degree of added-value in electricity markets. PowerMatcher Technology optimizes the potential for aggregated individual electricity producing and consuming devices to adjust their operation in order to increase the overall match between electricity production and consumption. There are already numerous implementations of PowerMatcher in the field, see implementations for a list of noticeable projects. If you want to contribute to PowerMatcher see the section Get Involved . Also, if you are curious what PowerMatcher can mean for your business or how to make business with PowerMatcher, see PowerMatcher Business Cases . PowerMatcher is maintained by the Flexiblepower Alliance Network and the open-source community. “PowerMatcher is an ICT technology for making the electricity grid smart .” PowerMatcher Mission Statement PowerMatcher aims to facilitate the implementation of standardized, scalable Smart Grids by providing a market-based coordination system for balancing demand and supply in clusters of distributed energy resources. Powermatcher intents to become the world’s standard for the Smart Grid, accessible to anyone. By becoming more and more widespread, barriers for smarter use of electricity will decrease. PowerMatcher relies on the open-source community in order to become the world standard.

They are charged using the existing electricity grid. But the grid may be overloaded if an increasing number of consumers charge their vehicles at the same time. ECN examines how to avoid such a peak load in the electricity grid. The answer is by using ECN’s PowerMatcher. PowerMatcher is a software technology developed by the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN). The technology harmonises the actions of electrical devices. To do so the software adds intelligence to devices like a battery charger for electrical vehicles. PowerMatcher determines automatically when the charger can best take electricity from the grid. It ‘sees’ when the electricity is expensive or inexpensive and whether there is a big or small supply of electricity and waits for the best moment to activate the charger. This controls the energy load on the grid to achieve the most favourable total load possible. Testing “To test PowerMatcher the ECN Efficiency & Infrastructure unit purchased a Toyota Prius,” explains Peter van der Laag, who works for ECN Intelligent Energy Grids. He is building up knowledge of grid-coupled electricity storage. “By charging the vehicle battery with PowerMatcher, we are studying how the battery responds, its efficiency, how long charging takes and what service life the battery has. The vehicle is equipped with test equipment to measure the battery’s behaviour and to analyse data”. The vehicle is eye-catching. Emblazoned with ECN logos and texts like I love stopcontacten [power outlets], the Toyota Prius catches the attention of many road users. Van der Laag: “We’ve replaced the standard battery by a far more powerful lithium ion battery with twelve times as much storage capacity, approximately 6 KWh. It is charged in the ordinary way using the grid, with a 1 kW charger fitted in the boot. We will soon have a rapid charger that lets the vehicle cover 45 km electrically with just a 30-minute charging time. This is enough capacity for a majority of journeys. With a full tank of petrol is possible to drive more than 900 km.” Future The Policy Studies unit and Engineering & Services unit are also involved in the research. Together with research and test institute KEMA and grid operators, the Policy Studies unit is examining the pros and cons of introducing electrical vehicles on a large scale. Engineering & Services is responsible for making technical modifications to the vehicle and for the grid connection. A unique possibility is that PowerMatcher could also be capable of supplying electricity to the grid from the vehicle’s battery. Talks are currently in progress with market parties on the marketing of PowerMatcher.

The theme of this year’s conference was: Innovation in Electricity Distribution for a Sustainable Future. CIRED is the leading International Conference on Electricity Distribution. The PowerMatcher related papers cover a wide range of topics: from field test upscaling via Smart Houses and Smart Substations to intelligent software agent strategies. Three papers were presented in the Distributed Energy Resources leg of the conference. Bart Roossien presented his paper on field test experiences in the one of the two main sessions. His paper describes the upscaling in consecutive PowerMatcher field tests. From a few units in the Crisp field test to approaching 100 units in the field test in the Integral project. The latter test is entering its roll-out phase in the coming period. Koen Kok presented a paper on Smart Houses delivering power flexibility services to both active distribution management and energy trading. The paper has been a cooperation effort within the SmartHouse/SmartGrid project. It describes different smart grid functionalities (use cases). Further, if gives a qualitative analysis of impacts on energy efficiency and efficient network management. The presentation of this paper was part of a round table session on research directions. Other interesting talks in this session are held by Enexis and Enel. The three talks in the session initiated a lively discussion among speakers and the audience. The third presented paper is more theoretical in nature and is part of Kok’s PhD work. It analyses different strategies of local control agents in a Virtual Power Plant. The fourth paper was presented by Josco Kester in one of the sessions on Network Components. On behalf of an industry consortium, Josco presented the Smart Distribution Station, a smart MV/LV-station able of managing power flows while maintaining power quality and reliability. A prototype of this station is currently being tested in the Flex Power Grid Lab in Arnhem (NL). Demonstration in a live test grid of the Dutch grid operator Liander will be conducted in a later stage. First simulation results show a significant reduction of harmonic voltages and resonances, as well as a peak load reduction of 30%. PowerMatcher technology integrated in the station is contributing to the latter.

The current increase in renewable energy sources makes matching of energy demand and supply more and more an urgent matter. On October 28th, around 120 professionals from Flanders and The Netherlands gathered in Breda for the First PowerMatcher Seminar. The broad group of attendants, for the largest part representing industrial parties, learned how the PowerMatcher technology makes its step from research to implementation. The seminar consisted of a series of interesting presentations by distribution system operators, energy suppliers, energy system providers and others. Most of them tested and demonstrated the PowerMatcher in different pilot projects, or are planning to do so in the near future. The PowerMatcher was shown to be applicable in concrete business cases for industrial virtual power plants, the introduction of electrical vehicles and smart coordination of home appliances.

Together with industry partners, TNO is currently developing the PowerMatcher technology into a flexible power platform available for open use in smart grid projects worldwide. jantje EcoGrid The EcoGrid solution enables the electricity grid to handle large amounts of renewable energy. It demonstrates the ability of the Danish island of Bornholm’s energy system to handle a large share of wind energy. More than 50% of the electricity supply on the island is coming from renewable energy sources. The central idea of the EcoGrid EU is the introduction of market-based mechanisms to release balancing capacity, particularly from flexible consumption. Approximately 2,000 residential consumers (out of a total of 28,000 customers) participate in this Smart Grid demonstration project, with flexible demand response tied to real-time price signals. The EcoGrid EU demonstration project is among the largest EU-funded Smart Grid projects. The jury report emphasizes the significant challenge of integrating large amounts of renewable energy from wind and solar farms into the electricity grid as we know it. “Raising eyebrows all over Europe for its ability to handle large amounts of fluctuating renewable energy in its system, the EcoGrid project of Bornholm is a demonstration of the future of energy grids” says the jury. “The size of the project, and the amount of fluctuating renewables integrated, make the project particularly noteworthy”, according the report. TNO’s PowerMatcher is one of the technologies demonstrated on the Danish island. The system will turn a planned 700 houses into smart homes that react to the electricity price and buy the needed electricity as cheap as possible. “As the price will go down during an unexpected peak in renewable energy production consumption will go up. This will help the integration of renewables”, says TNO expert George Huitema, the TNO-internal project leader. “We let the electricity consumption on the island follow the wind energy generation more closely.” The EcoGrid project means a significant step in the number of households handled by the PowerMatcher. “The technology has been designed for scalability”, says Huitema, “so we are confident we will make this project a success. The inclusion in this prestigious Sustainia100 list is the icing on the cake.” PowerMatching City The PowerMatching City project focusses on reversed relationship between supply and demand in the coming smart power grid. Where electricity production (supply) used to respond to demand from consumers, the smart power grid of the future will enable consumers to respond to fluctuations in supply of electricity generated from renewable sources. The project is centered around a living-lab of 25 households in the Hoogkerk district of the City of Groningen in the Netherlands. The PowerMatching City project demonstrates the ability of consumers to be active players in the energy system by providing them with demand response capabilities. Heat, for example, is produced for the building with heat pumps when very cheap electricity is available, and then stored for later use. At the same time, consumers generate their own electricity with photovoltaic solar panels and micro combined heat and power units. In addition, they are able to exchange energy with each other on a local energy market. Joost Laarakkers, the TNO-internal project leader: “This local market has been realized using TNO’s PowerMatcher technology. The system gives priority to the locally produced electricity and to green electricity from outside the district above less-sustainable energy sources.” Again, the jury stresses the importance of demand response in the grid as one of the primary ways to integrate higher amounts of renewable energy into the system. “When demand for energy becomes flexible, intermittent renewable energy becomes more competitive, as the need for storage, grid interconnection, or backup capacity is reduced”, according to the jury report. Partners TNO’s partners in EcoGrid are: transmission system operators Energinet.dk (Denmark) and ELIA (Belgium), distribution network operators Østkraft (Denmark), EDP (Portugal) and Eandis (Belgium), technology companies Siemens, IBM and Landis+Gyr, and knowledge providers SINTEF (Norway), the Danish Technical University DTU, EnCT (Germany), Technalia (Spain), AIT (Austria), ECN (The Netherlands) and the Tallinna University of Technology (Estonia).

Last september, when the days got shorter and the nights colder, the heat demand of the households started to increase, requiring the micro-CHP and heat pump units to provide heat. Using thermal buffers filled with 200 liters of water, the flexibility of these systems is used to optimize the system. The first measurement campaign involved the reduction of imbalance caused by a wind turbine. This imbalance is caused by the difference between its predicted power output (24 hours ahead) and the realized power output as shown in the figure below. Imbalance is caused by the day-ahead forecasted power being not equal to the realized power of a wind turbine. The PowerMatcher technology was used to coordinate the CHPs and heat pumps to compensate this imbalance. Reduction of imbalance is benificial for everyone. There are less costs for the operator of the wind turbine, as imbalance is normally compensated by (expensive) gas fired turbines. Furthermore, reduction of imbalance is also a business opportunity for the end-customers of CHPs and heat pumps as they can share in these savings. During a two-week measurement campaign, the PowerMatching City cluster was able to reduce the imbalance of a single 15 kW wind turbine by 58%.

In the Dutch situation demand of electricity occurs simultaneously with demand of heat, high electricity peak loads in the low voltage network are expected. Uncommonly for the Netherlands, in certain newly built areas there is no opportunity for a gas infrastructure. The power of the heat pump is typically 2.2 kW and the power of the electric resistance heating, which is available as a backup for cold days, is 6 kW. The peak power exceeds the power of 1.1 kVA, which is a characteristic value for a Dutch household at the distribution level. To facilitate such a newly built residential area, network distribution companies had to design an electricity network where electric power is served by two local distribution stations of 630 kVA which serve 124 houses equipped with heat pumps. Also an extra track for the medium voltage transmission level had to be constructed, raising total costs to about 1.5 M€. The question was raised whether a smart grid solution could decrease network reinforcements costs. Research is focussed on domestic residences with high peak loads at substations when heating is provided merely by heat pumps with additional electric resistance heating. Two scenarios are studied: the event of a black start in the electricity system and high electricity demand on a day with a very low outdoor temperature. The simulation is performed with eventually 100 agents representing up to 100 dwellings based on PowerMatcher technology. The results demonstrate significant peak load reduction can be achieved as shown in the figure below. In case of a black start PowerMatcher is able to maintain the maximum load at the substation below a certain maximum load as well as on a cold morning. It was also demonstrated this peak load reduction is at the expense of only a small decrease of comfort.
