What is open source?

* [opensource.com](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
* [Open source initiative](http://opensource.org/osd)

There are multiple reasons to use the open source model. Here are some examples:

1. [Openess always wins in the end!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzoV57EW1uU)
2. [Open source is part of the sharing economy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbcgmf6eDKU)
3. [Open source software moves faster to commodity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnFeIt-uaEc)
4. [The open source model can lead to more innovation](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/openinnovsoftware)
5. [Reduced vendor-lock-in](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/whoneedssource)
